$ Taher Jamali's personal portfolio

This is my first attempt at building a website that showcases my skills as a software engineer. 
I wanted to create this website to challenge myself and also to show potential employers what
I can bring to the table. I am using a template from HTML5 and personalizing it to my needs. 
It is just a first attempt so be forgiving of the crude errors and unintentional mistakes.

I want to thank ajlkn for creating and providing this template.
