Taher Jamali's personal portfolio

This is my first attempt at building a website that showcases my skills as a software engineer. 
I wanted to create this website to challenge myself and also to show potential employers what
I can bring to the table. I am using a template from HTML5 and personalizing it to my needs. 
It is just a first attempt so be forgiving of the crude errors and unintentional mistakes.

I want to thank ajlkn and HTML5 for creating and providing this template.

This is Forty, my latest and greatest addition to HTML5 UP and, per its incredibly
creative name, my 40th (woohoo)! It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that are
set up to smoothly transition to secondary landing pages (for which a separate page
template is provided), and includes a number of neat effects (check out the menu!),
extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!
